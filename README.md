# meet-here

## Synopsis
Meet Here (dead drop) makes it easy for users to determine a equidistant point to meet. It is the front-end capstone project for NSS part time developer bootcamp. Meet here can be accessed [live](https://meet-here-1512138438348.firebaseapp.com/#!/).

## Overview
As a user you should be able to choose between a short distance "meet now" or long distance "meet later" meet in which you can generically enter 2 locations and your preferred meeting location type (cafe, campground, atm, etc.) and a central meeting point will be displayed with markers around that point matching the place type. The results can then be saved, viewed, edited, and deleted at a later point.
